Hello thank you for inviting me to take the test! 

For the Outlook 2007 format I believe I got my email as far as possible without creating a separate email design. 

I used border for spacing which works great on most inboxes but not in Outlook. Also the alignment of the first and last unordered list are slightly off. Otherwise I think the design and Javascript are complete!
